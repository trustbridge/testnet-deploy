# node-operation-example-aws

This repository is used to host the bits and pieces required to deploy trustbridge components into an AWS based environment using the [hamlet](https://hamlet.io) deployment framework.

The process and tools used here are not specific to hamlet and are tools that we have used to make the deployment work.

## Hamlet Plugin

This repo also contains a hamlet plugin which can be used to deploy scalable production capable deployments of the trustbridge components.

see hamlet/trustbrdige for the plugin details
